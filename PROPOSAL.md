# GLITCH: Game Live-InTime Consensus Hub 👁️

## 1. The Concept
Glitch is a **Micro-Frequency Prediction Market** for live streaming events (Twitch, YouTube Live, Kick). Unlike platforms that focus on long-term events (like elections), Glitch focuses on events that settle in seconds.

**Example Markets:**
*   "Will Shroud win this Valorant round?" (Settles in 2 minutes)
*   "Will Kai Cenat scream in the next 60 seconds?" (Settles in 1 minute)

## 2. Why Solana? (Unique Use Case)
This project is impossible on Ethereum due to speed and cost.
*   **Speed:** Markets must open and close within 60 seconds. Solana’s 400ms block time makes this viable.
*   **Blinks:** Glitch allows users to place bets directly inside the Twitch/YouTube chat using Solana Blinks.

## 3. How It Works
1.  **Overlay Experience:** Designed as a Stream Companion App.
2.  **Session Keys:** Users sign one transaction at the start to authorize betting for the whole stream (no constant wallet pop-ups).
3.  **AI Vision Oracle:** Decentralized AI nodes watch the stream and use Computer Vision to detect "Victory" or "Defeat" screens to settle bets instantly without humans.

## 4. Business Model
*   **Streamer Partnership:** Streamers get a % of the betting volume on their channel.
*   **Fee Structure:** 1% fee on winning bets (0.5% to platform, 0.5% to the streamer).
